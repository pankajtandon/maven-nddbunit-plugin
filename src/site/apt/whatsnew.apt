NayiDisha DBUnit Plugin version 2.0.0

    The maven-nddbunit-plugin version 2.0.0 has two main improvements over version 1.0.0
    
    * The configuration file is now externalized. No longer will you have to deal with a pom.xml cluttered with plugin config.
    
    * The data that is generated by the autoExport goal is now more failsafe in that it is not dependent on the order in which the 
    foreign keys are processed.
